Hi David,

Thanks again for offering to record some voicelines. Top priority is just a few lines for the trailer:

* "wut, me?! it was all ball!"
* "ref, are you fuckin' blind?!"
* a few grunts
* a few sly chuckles at the injured player
* a few growls (especially as a lead up to punching the ref)

But I have gone ahead and started working out my whole list (see below), but let me know what you think creatively/production-wise. 

You don't have to strictly say exactly what I've written and can just kinda spout off whatever and I'll try to chop things up. I plan on just splicing in different words into the same insulting sentences and it's fine, maybe even preferable, if it's noticeable.

Just have fun!
